# Steam-Tracker
Tracks and visualizes hours in Steam games.

This program tracks activity using `controller_ui.txt`. On Windows machines, this can usually be found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\logs`.

To run the program:

`python hours.py`

Optionally, to specify the path to the file:

`python hours.py --path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\logs\controller_ui.txt"`
